(Full, true story of Move-In Day). Move in - none of my well crafted goodbye happened. I Cried for 2 weeks before drop off, and actually months before if i thought to much about him leaving. I had a nice letter typed and ready with a special gift to put in his pillow for him to find. Woke up at 3 am in hotel before drop off and in my head for 2 hours I composed another which I transcribed on the back of Expedia hotel info on the 8 minute trip to the dorm. T...his 3 page mess was added to the goodbye package along with the graduation card I had forgotten to give him. Fully an hour before our designated good by time he says we are done ( and well yes we really were and orientation is starting ) after he almost ran from me I got an embrace so quick no time to cry., he turned and was gone. I was standing there sort of stunned.  Mike and i moved on to our orientation. Then the sky darkened to a green black color. We joked it was a shark nado and tried to hurry away from the large trees we were near. Moments later a Huge lightening strike had my husband and I jump out of our skins and the hair on our arms stand up. A few paces on we see a huge dead and somewhat smoldering hawk that moments before had been enjoying the view from the Sadler Stadium lights. Deciding to inform someone we head to the Student Center where we fun into  Grants favorite teacher & an alumni who wrote his recommendations (& whose daughter is now enrolling). He assures me the kid is ready and going to thrive. Walking past us is are not one but two  completely distraught girls with helpless parents trailing behind.  So to summarize: bums rush goodbye with no tears, Mike and  I dodged a deadly lightening strike, we missed getting hit by a dead hawk, our son's room is 20 square feet shorter than all the otters and has a leak  and apparently, in my emotional mom state I left him a thought full gift and a jumble of goodbye letters making me look like a teenage girl or lunatic mom giving him junk mail. I have been way to embarrassed to ask if he found them.

Duke, professor of psychology at Emory University. . ""It is a moment that comes along once in a lifetime. Each child only starts college once [...] Such moments are rare. They have power. They give us as parents one-time opportunities to say things to our children that will stick with them not only because of what is said, but because of when it is said,"" Duke says. ""Here is what I tell the parents: Think of what you want to tell your children when you finally tak...e leave of them and they go off to their dorm and the beginning of their new chapter in life and you set out for the slightly emptier house that you will now live in. What thoughts, feelings and advice do you want to stick? 'Always make your bed!'? 'Don't wear your hair that way!'? Surely not. This is a moment to tell them the big things. Things you feel about them as children, as people. Wise things. Things that have guided you in your life. Ways that you hope they will live. Ways that you hope they will be. Big things. Life-level things.""

It was late afternoon at the Folk Alliance Region West (FAR-West) music conference, and Mark went down to the hotel lobby to enjoy some quiet time and tend to some email. “So much for quiet,"" he said. ""A couple of musicians were playing there on a whim. Yet their music was so irresistible that I found myself enchanted rather than disgruntled. Giving up ...on my email, I Nathan & Jessieapproached them and asked, ‘Who are you?!’” Nathan Rivera and Jessie Andra Smith, better known as Nathan and Jessie, often get that reaction as they play on streets and stages throughout the U.S., Mexico, and Europe. Their jazz-influenced folk and blues, performed on resonator guitars and accordion with multilingual vocal harmonies, is unfailingly uplifting and fun, with a message for people of all ages and cultures. You can’t help but smile when you hear it. See and hear Nathan and Jessie at nathanandjessie.com In a living room concert Sunday, September 4 at 2:00 PM 933 Rose Avenue, Oakland, CA 94611 $20 in advance, $25 at the door (All proceeds go to the musicians) Reservations are required.

La Festa si svolgerà nei giorni 29-30-31 maggio, 1 e 2 giugno ...ai Giardini Margherita. Il tema di quest'anno è ""L'INCONTRO"" e il titolo lo dice chiaramente: ""Sarà che mi hai guardato come nessuno mai - La vita rinasce da un incontro"".  Perchè questo tema e questo titolo? Ci siamo lasciati colpire e interrogare dai recenti fatti accaduti in Italia, in Europa e nel mondo: le stragi di Parigi, l’inasprimento del dibattito sui temi sociali come ad esempio l'educazione, la famiglia e il matrimonio, le condizioni tremende in cui si svolge il flusso migratorio dal nord Africa, la persecuzione dei cristiani in diverse parti del mondo. Abbiamo riflettuto anche sui giudizi che Papa Francesco e don Julian Carron hanno dato su queste situazioni, e abbiamo deciso che il tema della nostra Festa quest’anno doveva essere l’Incontro. Incontro come possibilità di apertura e conoscenza dell’altro, a partire dall’esperienza che ciascuno fa. Apertura che ci può portare a vedere l'altro come una risorsa e quindi a guardarlo con curiosità e simpiatia, cosicchè la diversità non sia più un obiezione, ma diventi un di più, perché mi porta un contributo. È possibile un incontro così? È interessante per noi? Dove l'abbiamo vissuto e lo viviamo oggi? Come possiamo educare lo sguardo nostro e dei nostri piccoli ad una apertura così, libera, accogliente e disarmata? Siamo convinti che riscoprire questa possibilità sia una sfida interessante per noi, perché punto di verifica della nostra esperienza di cristiani e quindi di uomini e per tutti coloro, qualunque sia la loro esperienza, che accetteranno questo invito. La festa è un'occasione per questo, per educare noi e i nostri figli a questo sguardo, per mettere in comune la nostra esperienza e così crescere sperimentando il di più che viene da questa apertura che non è un ideale astratto, ma ciò per cui il cuore è fatto. Saranno dei giorni ricchi di giochi, sport, laboratori per bambini, musica e dibatti culturali. Saranno dei giorni di festa aperti a tutta la città di Bologna. Per questo invitiamo chi vuole a partecipare fin da ora alla costruzione della festa, perché vorremmo condividere con tutti la bellezza che stiamo vivendo e perchè siamo convinti che il contributo che ognuno può portare sia una ricchezza unica.

One of the best I've seen. This is at the University Technologi Petronas, the largest private university in Malaysia. The book shelves alone run 6 floors high!  That said, I'm very skeptical about the future of libraries. With all the knowledge available at fingertips, I wonder what's the reason for such huge libraries. To validate my thought, only a handful of students were at the library.LikeShow more reactionsCommentShare1049113 1131 shareCommentsView 9 more commentsRemoveNikhil Khedekar May be they have good donations :DLike · Reply · 1 · Yesterday at 3:06amNikhil Khedekar replied · 2 RepliesRemoveMurali Krishnan Purely for Nostalgia Kribs. ...

The biggest advantage of an old-fashioned land line (i.e., one provided by the phone company rather than an ISP/VOIP provider) is that these lines provide their own power, letting you use them even during a power outage. Another advantage is better location provision when you call for emergency services, though cell phones have gotten much better at that.lifehacker.comShare",0.0," recommends Robert Vadra's rebuttal: Is it convincing?October 9, 2012 · ",0.0," recommends Arvind Kejriwal: Revolutionary or anarchist?October 9, 2012 · ",0.0," recommends Robert Vadra and DLF accused of illicit links by Arvind Kejriwal.October 9, 2012 · See More 2012 StoriesDecember 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 20122011Show 20112010Show 20102009Show 20092008Show 20082007Show 20072006Show 200620052004200320022001Show 200120001999Show 19991998199719961995Show 19951994199319921991Show 19911990198919881987198619851984198319821981Show 1981IntroStudied at Global Institute of Technology (GIT) JaipurPhotosFriendsPrivacy · Terms · Advertising · Ad Choices · Cookies · More Facebook © 2016",0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So vote menteri belia2 la.See TranslationKhairy JamaluddinLike Page17 hrs · Masih tak boleh move on dari kemenangan Ridzuan dan Ziyad awal pagi tadi. Tergerak hati nak ceritakan peristiwa tiga tahun lepas. Saya baru dua bulan sahaja dil...antik jadi Menteri Sukan. Tiba-tiba terima berita dari Lyon, France seorang atlet negara bernama Ziyad Zolkefli telah menang di kejohanan olahraga dunia. Dunia beb!  Lepas saya terima berita tersebut saya tanya pegawai semada kementerian menyediakan insentif untuk kemenangan tersebut. Saya diberi jawapan memang ada. ""Tapi YB jumlah yang diberi kurang sebab ini sukan para."" Saya tanya kurang berapa. ""Atlet para ni dapat 30% dari nilai ganjaran atlet biasa/normal."" Beberapa hari kemudian ada mesyuarat Lembaga Majlis Sukan Negara. Saya selaku Menteri dan juga Pengerusi MSN sendiri bangkitkan isu ganjaran untuk atlet para. Saya kata tidak adil mereka terima insentif kurang dari atlet biasa. Saya cadangkan kita tukar polisi ini. Bagi sama rata. Macam-macam hujah diberi untuk menidakkan cadangan saya. ""Paralimpik ini baharu."" ""Acara mereka tak ramai penyertaan."" ""Paralimpik ini terlalu banyak kategori acara, mudah untuk menang."" Nampak gaya lembaga cenderung untuk menolak cadangan saya.  Saya teringat balik pada Ziyad dan pengorbanannya. Takkan saya mengalah sedangkan beliau mengatasi segala kekurangan untuk menjadi juara dunia? Bilik mesyuarat senyap, menunggu Menteri baharu, muda dan mentah menyerah kalah di tangan para otai pentadbir sukan. Saya pinjamkan semangat Ziyad dan saya tanya satu soalan sahaja. Saya masih ingat, saya tanya dalam Bahasa Inggeris. ""Do any of you around this table know what it takes to become a world champion with a disability? What it takes to overcome your disability and succeed?"" Tiada seorang pun dapat menjawab. Saya sambung, ""Baiklah, daripada sekarang atlet Malaysia semua, tak kira biasa ke, para ke, diberi ganjaran yang sama."" Terima kasih Ziyad kerana memberi saya semangat untuk mengubah layanan terhadap atlet para tiga tahun lepas. Hari ini Malaysia is one of the only countries in the world yang memberi insentif sama kepada atlet biasa dan atlet 'luarbiasa'.  Our para athletes' achievements and sacrifices must be honoured the same as other athletes. Not 30% of 'normal' athletes. I would not know how to feel 30% proud of them. I only feel 100% proud of our para heroes. They have shown us that yes, they  are not ordinary. They are extraordinary. LUAR BIASA!

Από την διηνεκή καταστρατήγηση των δικαιωμάτων των άτομων με ψυχιατρική εμπειρία (υπάρχουν περιπτώσεις για τις οποίες θα χρειαστούν πιθανώς συγκεκριμένες δράσεις), μέσα σ΄ ένα όλο και πιο κατασταλτικό (και σε προϊούσα κατάρρευση) σύστημα υπηρεσιών-μέχρι τον ρόλο των ΜΚΟ ψυχικής υγείας, που τα σκάνδαλά τους (στην πραγματικότητα, το σκανδαλώδες της ίδιας της ύπαρξής τους) δεν μπορούν πια να συγκαλύπτονται και ξεσπάνε ανοιχτά, δημιουργώντας μια περαιτέρω κρίση μέσα στο ίδιο το πολιτικό σύστημα και στο Υπουργείο Υγείας ως προς τον τρόπο διαχείρισης αυτών των σκανδάλων (που οι αποκαλύψεις γι΄αυτά είναι μόνο στην αρχή τους). Θα συζητήσουμε, επίσης, πάνω σε προτάσεις για την συνέχεια των εκπαιδευτικών συναντήσεων της ""Πρωτοβουλίας"" που έγιναν με σημαντική επιτυχία τον προηγούμενο χρόνο.
